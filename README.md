# Sorting algorithms visualizer

This is an algorithm visualizer written in typescript.
I am a newbie to typescript and so this was an opportunity for me to grasp something
about typescript.

# The algorithms Visualized

The algorithms visualized are merger sort, quick sort, heap sort and bubble sort.
Seeing the visual representation of these algorithms is just amazing.
